# image-qual
An image quality analyzer built with Python, OpenCV, and a machine learning classifier. The system extracts five key image quality metrics: brightness, contrast, noise, resolution, and blurriness. It uses a trained RandomForest model to predict whether an image is of good or bad quality. It is deployed with Streamlit for interactive use.
